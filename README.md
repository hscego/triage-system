# triage-system
A priority queue system for a hospital emergency room. The nurse will determine the patient's priority based on their injury or illness and enter the patient's full name along with the urgency level.
Coded in C++, I have three files: p.cpp is the main driver program, Patient.h is the header file, and PatientPriorityQueue.h is the implementation file.
